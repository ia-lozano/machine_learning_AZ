Accuracy is not enough, so you should also look at other performance metrics like Precision (measuring exactness), Recall (measuring completeness) and the F1 Score (compromise between Precision and Recall). Please find below these metrics formulas (TP = # True Positives, TN = # True Negatives, FP = # False Positives, FN = # False Negatives):

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

F1 Score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)

3. Try even other classification models that we haven't covered in Part 3 - Classification. Good ones for NLP include:

CART

C5.0

Maximum Entropy
